								<h2>WHY YOU NEED THIS PUPPY!</h2>
							</header>
							<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/pics10.jpg" alt=""></a>
							<p><h3>History</h3> The Akita originated in Akita, Japan and was originally developed in the 19th century as a watchdog and hunting dog. It is believed that the Akita was brought to the United States by Helen Keller, who took a liking to the breed after visiting Japan. After World War II, the Akita's popularity began to grow, as American servicemen who were stationed in Japan brought more Akitas to the United States. Over time, the American Akita started to evolve into a stronger, more robust dog than the Japanese Akita. The breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1972. 

							</p>
							<p><h3>Temperament</h3>Akitas are alert, dignified, and courageous. They're fairly friendly and are very affectionate and loving with family members, but have a tendency to be hesitant around strangers. This breed has a variable temperament and requires experienced handling. Akitas can become aggressive and willful if not trained properly, so it's important to set boundaries and rules for an Akita during puppyhood. This breed isn't inherently good with children, but they can get along with them if carefully socialized. Because training an Akita can be somewhat difficult, they're not recommended for first-time dog owners. With the right owner, the Akita makes an outstanding pet and loyal guardian of the family.</p>
							<p><h3><a href="index.html">Feel Like Getting One Already?</a></h3>  To learn more about the Akita dog breed, just keep reading:</p>

								<p>The Akita is a large and powerful dog with a variable temperament requiring experienced handling. Originating in Japan the Akita was originally developed in the 19th century as a fighting dog. Some countries now regard the American Akita as a separate breed than that of the Japanese Akita, also known as the Japanese Akita Inu. Despite its size and sometimes willful and aloof behavior, the Akita makes a great family dog with its intelligence and affectionate loyalty.</p>
								
								 
								
								<p> Akita has a double coat much like those of the other breeds of the Spitz or Nordic family. The color of the Japanese Akita is a distinctive red-fawn with white markings while the American Akita can be any color although typically the colors are fawn with black overlays and white markings.</p>
								
								 
								
								<p> large and well-built, this strikingly handsome breed has a deep, wide chest and a well proportioned head with triangular erect ears and, in the American Akita, a dark face mask. They have a thick bushy tail which curls over their backs. The height of the Akita ranges from 23-28 inches and there weight can vary from 65 to 115 pounds with the Japanese Akita usually ranging smaller than that of its close American cousin.</p>
								
								 
								
								<p>The temperament of the Akita breed is alert and dignified, usually friendly and docile, and very courageous. They are affectionate and loving with its family but can be aggressive and willful if not trained properly. Care must be taken that their rules are set at an early age as they have a tendency to become domineering, especially with other dogs. With the right owner, the Akita makes an outstanding pet and/or guardian of the family.</p>
