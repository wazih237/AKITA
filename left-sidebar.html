				<h2>WHY YOU NEED THIS PUPPY!</h2>
			</header>
			<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/pics10.jpg" alt=""></a>



<p><h3>Appearance</h3>
The Akita puppy, with his fuzzy coat, rounded frame, and disproportionately enormous paws, invites plenty of “awws,” but he grows into a formidable adult. “They’re a pretty sturdy breed, that’s for sure,” Caballero says. The height of an American Akita ranges from 24 to 28 inches at the shoulder, and the breed can weigh between 70 and 130 pounds. He has a massive head with a broad muzzle, pointy ears, and small, deep-set brown eyes. His thick double coat, which sheds minimally and needs regular brushing, can be any color, including white, brindle, or pinto, with well-defined markings across his burly body. The Akita’s distinctive tail raises over his back in a fluffy curl.

The Japanese Akita, known as the Akita Inu, looks similar to the American Akita, but tends to be more petite. Another difference between them is that the American Akita can be any color, while the Japanese is usually red, brindle, or white. While the Japanese Akita is sometimes confused with the Shiba Inu in terms of appearance, it’s easy to tell them apart in terms of adult size: the Akita is large, while the Shiba Inu is small.

A number of Akita mix breeds are also available, including a Labrakita (Labrador retriever plus Akita), shepkita (German shepherd plus Akita), and Akipoo (Akita plus poodle), to name a few.

</p>

<p><h3>Care</h3>The Akita has a reputation for being fairly odorless and easy to housebreak. However, if he’s spending a lot of time outside his coat can get dirty, and it will need to be brushed and groomed frequently. “A clean Akita doesn’t smell. But an Akita that lives outside is going to smell,” Caballero says. “That’s why grooming them is important.” The Akita’s thick coat sheds minimally throughout the year until warm weather hits, and then—look out! The once-a-year shedding is sure to cover the entire house. Regular nail trimming and teeth brushing are also important to an Akita’s health.

This breed requires moderate exercise, and if he’s not getting that from guarding the yard, a daily jog or long walk will suffice. “Just like in humans, a walk outside is mentally calming and relaxes them and exercises them,” Caballero says. “This breed can gain weight pretty quickly if they’re pretty sedentary. If they’re at home not doing much, getting treats, laying around? They’re going to get overweight.”

Training should start early and happen frequently—calmness and consistency is key—because these fluffy puppies grow into large, strong, independent-minded adults that will go to great lengths to protect their owner. “The main thing with this breed is you’re going to have to be super strict in training it as a puppy,” Caballero says. “Because otherwise their instincts will take over.”

</p>

<p><h3>Health</h3>
For a large dog, the Akita’s lifespan is long, at 10 to 13 years. However, the breed is prone to a number of health conditions, including hip dysplasia, arthritis, hypothyroidism, and eye problems. 

The Akita is also prone to gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) or bloat, which is a life-threatening emergency that occurs when the dog’s stomach twists and cuts off blood supply. Caballero recommends Akita puppy owners consider a surgery called gastropexy, where the side of the stomach is tacked to the abdomen wall so it can’t flip. “If I get one of those breeds, that would be the first thing I would do to prevent them from twisting the stomach,” he says. “Because [if your dog experiences GDV] you go to the ER and you either spend $8,000 to $10,000 in surgery, or you have to put your dog to sleep.”

Akita owners should talk to their veterinarians about preventive options for health risks their own dogs may face.</p>


			<p><h3>History</h3> The Akita originated in Akita, Japan and was originally developed in the 19th century as a watchdog and hunting dog. It is believed that the Akita was brought to the United States by Helen Keller, who took a liking to the breed after visiting Japan. After World War II, the Akita's popularity began to grow, as American servicemen who were stationed in Japan brought more Akitas to the United States. Over time, the American Akita started to evolve into a stronger, more robust dog than the Japanese Akita. The breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1972. 

			</p>
			<p> In Japan, the Akita is so revered that the family of a newborn child is often presented with a statue of an Akita, which symbolizes health, happiness, and long life. 
				In the Akita prefecture of Japan, where the dog originated, visitors can meet Akita dogs at a number of different businesses, including the Akita Dog Museum, the Akita Dog Visitor Center, the Ani Ski Resort, Furusawa Hot Springs, and the Royal Hotel Odate.
				Helen Keller fell in love with this breed after reading the story of famous Akita Hachiko, who faithfully waited nearly 10 years at a train station for his owner’s return, unaware the owner had—in fact—passed away. When Keller traveled in Japan in the 1930s to teach, she mentioned her interest in adopting one of these faithful dogs, and the Japanese government took her request to heart; when Keller returned to the United States, she was accompanied by an Akita.
				Perhaps the most famous Akita in recent years is LEGO Akita Minifigure, which is a part of the NINJAGO series</p>
			<p><h3>Temperament</h3>Akitas are alert, dignified, and courageous. They're fairly friendly and are very affectionate and loving with family members, but have a tendency to be hesitant around strangers. This breed has a variable temperament and requires experienced handling. Akitas can become aggressive and willful if not trained properly, so it's important to set boundaries and rules for an Akita during puppyhood. This breed isn't inherently good with children, but they can get along with them if carefully socialized. Because training an Akita can be somewhat difficult, they're not recommended for first-time dog owners. With the right owner, the Akita makes an outstanding pet and loyal guardian of the family.</p>
			<p><h3><a href="index.html">Feel Like Getting One Already?</a></h3>  To learn more about the Akita dog breed, just keep reading:</p>

				<p>The Akita is a large and powerful dog with a variable temperament requiring experienced handling. Originating in Japan the Akita was originally developed in the 19th century as a fighting dog. Some countries now regard the American Akita as a separate breed than that of the Japanese Akita, also known as the Japanese Akita Inu. Despite its size and sometimes willful and aloof behavior, the Akita makes a great family dog with its intelligence and affectionate loyalty.</p>
				
					
				
				<p> Akita has a double coat much like those of the other breeds of the Spitz or Nordic family. The color of the Japanese Akita is a distinctive red-fawn with white markings while the American Akita can be any color although typically the colors are fawn with black overlays and white markings.</p>
				
					
				
				<p> large and well-built, this strikingly handsome breed has a deep, wide chest and a well proportioned head with triangular erect ears and, in the American Akita, a dark face mask. They have a thick bushy tail which curls over their backs. The height of the Akita ranges from 23-28 inches and there weight can vary from 65 to 115 pounds with the Japanese Akita usually ranging smaller than that of its close American cousin.</p>
				
					
				
				<p>The temperament of the Akita breed is alert and dignified, usually friendly and docile, and very courageous. They are affectionate and loving with its family but can be aggressive and willful if not trained properly. Care must be taken that their rules are set at an early age as they have a tendency to become domineering, especially with other dogs. With the right owner, the Akita makes an outstanding pet and/or guardian of the family.</p>
